    <h1>Some of my favorite things to do</h1>
    <p>My name is Samoina and I am currently enrolled in Moringa school. Click <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">this </a> link to visit the website. I have been learning how to code, but beyond school I love to:
      <ul>
        <li>Listen to podcasts while on the move.</li>
        <li>Work out - <strong>fun fact, I've been doing home workouts since 2019!</strong></li>
        <li>Cook - I love a good plate of <em>pilau</em>.</li>
        <li>Meet new people but Corona kinda stopped reggae.</li>
        <li>Lastly, I love to dance to unwind too.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This is a list of the best destinations I have been to
      <ol>
        <li>Magadi - went on this trip in primary school and it was so memorable</li>
        <li>Diani - oh the white sandy beaches</li>
        <li>Nakuru - has some hidden gems, and i absolutely loved L. Nakuru!</li>
        <li>Portland - a dream come true in so many ways!</li>
      </ol>
