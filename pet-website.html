    <p>If you are a pet lover like me, you probably know how much we consider pets as family. This is an ode to my pet, Nala. Nala is a feisty German shepherd. I find her shiny black coat to be very beautiful. I wish I had a photo to show, but she closely resembles the lovely canine in the image below. <img src="images/pexels-adam-kontor-333083.jpg" alt="Picture of a German Shepherd">

    <p>Some of the things that Nala enjoys include:
      <ol>
        <li>playing with her toy, a rubbery one she likes to bite</li>
        <li>rolling on the ground for belly rubs</li>
        <li>going for walks</li>
      </ol>
